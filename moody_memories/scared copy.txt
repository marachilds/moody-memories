What%20if...no
I%20think%20there's%20someone%20in%20the%20room
What%20if%20I%20fall%20asleep%20and%20never%20wake up
When the door creaks open and you're home alone
Were those footsteps outside my door?
I swear it's like someone is watching me sometimes
I think I just heard a knock on my door
I don't think I'm gonna finish this paper on time
Do you ever feel a tickle on the back of your neck..
Did someone just call my name..
All of the lights are out
Ugh what if a clown just appeared in my room
arachnophobia is the fear of spiders
ophidiophobia is the fear of snakes
acrophobia is the fear of heights
claustrophobia is the fear of small spaces
trypophobia is the fear of holes
trypanophobia is the fear of needles
basiphobia is the fear of falling
triskaidekaphobia is the fear of the number 13
