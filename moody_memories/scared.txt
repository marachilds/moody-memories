What if...no
I think there's someone in the room
What if I fall asleep and never wake up
When the door creaks open and you're home alone
Were those footsteps outside my door?
I swear it's like someone is watching me sometimes
I think I just heard a knock on my door
I don't think I'm gonna finish this paper on time
Do you ever feel a tickle on the back of your neck..
Did someone just call my name..
All of the lights are out
Ugh what if a clown just appeared in my room
arachnophobia, the fear of spiders
ophidiophobia, the fear of snakes
acrophobia, the fear of heights
claustrophobia, the fear of small spaces
trypophobia, the fear of holes
trypanophobia, the fear of needles
basiphobia, the fear of falling
triskaidekaphobia, the fear of the number 13
