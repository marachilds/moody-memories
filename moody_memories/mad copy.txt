Bless your little heart
I'm sure you're doing the best you can
Good for you
Interesting..
K
That's nice
Who asked you..
*rolls eyes at you*
That's awesome for someone like you
It can't be that hard
Once in a while you have to make an effort...
Why. Just why
Not you, no, not you
Take a long walk on a short pier
Sure, that seems like something you could maybe handle
Why would you think you could do that
How many times do I have to tell you
Maybe if you asked me
Why is it always my job
You couldn't have told me..
